# Named-entities-recognition
Welcome to our repo where we explore Named Entity Recognition (NER), a crucial task in computational linguistics and AI. Using Conditional Random Fields (CRF) with nltk.tag.CRFTagger from NLTK, we aim to identify and classify proper names from text. Our work contributes to better understanding and structuring unstructured data.
